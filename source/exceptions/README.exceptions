Exceptions shouldn't induce additional costs when not used
(e.g. most people disable C++ exceptions because of the slow down)

For now the solution is to return a ReturnValue structure containing
a pointer to an exception (may be NULL if no exception is thrown) and
a pointer to the returned value (may be NULL if an exception is thrown).
