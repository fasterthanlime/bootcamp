I'm unsure how to handle this currently, but it's in my opinion
that we should support out-of-the-box:

 * Multi-dimensional arrays
 * Dynamic-sized arrays (e.g. better realloc)
 * Subsetting (ie. slicing)
 * Array literals

Tuples should be implemented as arrays - they're only an invariant
subset of them.
