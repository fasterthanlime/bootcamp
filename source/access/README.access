There are 4 basic cases to handle:

1) We access a variable as 'myVariable'
2) We call a function as 'myFunction(...)'
3) We access a member variable as 'myObject.myVariable'
4) We call a member function as 'myObject.myFunction()'

and two fallback cases:

5) We call a no-argument function as 'myFunction'
6) We call a no-argument member function as 'myObject.myFunction'
